# Packages.sh is a shell script that should be run in a fresh
# python virtual environment to install the latest versions
# of all packages required by dralithus-core.

# To run this script FIRST enable the virtual environment
# into which you want to install the packages
# Typically, this is done as follows:
# source ./venv/bin/activate

# This script should ONLY be run if you want to upgrade command_lines's
# package dependencies to the latest versions.
# Otherwise the simply install requirements.txt once you've activated
# the virtual environment, as follows:
# python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Standard python tools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install pylint
python3 -m pip install mypy

# Testing support
python3 -m pip install parameterized

# Update requirements.txt
python3 -m pip freeze >requirements.txt
