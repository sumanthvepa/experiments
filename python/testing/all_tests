  all_tests: Run all tests in the test directory

  This is a convenience script that runs all tests in the test directory.
  It is intended to be used as a convenience script for developers
  to allow them to run the entire suite from the command line easily.

  The same can be accomplished by the following command:
  python3 -m unittest discover -s test
