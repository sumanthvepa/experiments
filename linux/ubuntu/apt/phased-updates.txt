Starting ubuntu 24.04, apt now shows that some packages are not updated
because of 'phased updates'.

Phased updates are a way for Ubuntu to roll out updates for a subset
of users to see if the updates cause any problems before rolling
them out to everyone.

For systems where you want stability, it is good to have phased
updates. 

For systems where you need the latest packages as quickly as
possible, and where system stability is not a concern,
you can diable phased updates:

Phased updates can be disabled as follows:
Create file 02phased-updates in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
The file should have the following contents:

Update-Manager::Always-Include-Phased-Updates true;
APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates true;

You can also simply copy the file from this directory
to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/

You can find more details on how phased updates in ubuntu work
