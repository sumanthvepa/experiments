This project is an exploration of the Dart programming language.
Each exploration is a module in the `lib` directory.
The modules are called in order they should be studied from the `main`
function in `bin/main.dart`.

There is no real need for testing in the application so the test suite
is essentially a dummy.

A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.
