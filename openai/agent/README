You need to set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY for the code
to work. The value of this is found in the .env file which is NOT
checked into source control. 

If you are attempting to run the program from within IntelliJ IDEA
edit your run configuration and add the environment variable
OPENAI_API_KEY set to your API key.

To run the code, you need to supply your own OpenAI API key.
