As of macOS Sequoia, on Macs you need to give
permission to VSCode to allow it to connect to the
local network. Pings or ssh to such machines won't work
until you do so.

Open the Settings app on macOS
Select 'Privacy & Security' in the panel on the left
Scroll down the panel on the right until you find Local Network,
and select it.
Locate the entry containing VisualStudio Code and push the
toggle button on.


Now follow the regular instructions for Remote SSH

Meta-Shift-P to open the command palette
Search for Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...
Select the host or add one...

This should open a new window with a remote connection.
