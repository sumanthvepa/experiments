This is a Makefile and Xcode project to demonstrate how
boost::lexical_cast works.

Note on Makefile and Xcode projects
Both the Makefile project and the Xcode project generate 
code in different places. The output of the Makefile is
in the build directory, while Xcode's output is not
directly findable. So building the project in Xcode
will not result in any outout into the build directory
and running the Makefile using make will not cause
the project to be built in Xcode.

The Makefile should work with both MacOS make as well
as gmake.

Location of the boost library.
The Makefile assumes that the boost library is
located at /opt/boost/1_84_0/.
Header files for boost are assumed to be at
/opt/boost/1_84_0/include
Libraries for boost are assumed to be at:
/opt/boost/1_84_0/lib.

If that is not the case change the Makefile and
the settings in Xcode

lexical_cast > Build Settings > Search Paths > Header Search Path
and 
lexical_cast > Build Settings > Search Paths > Library Search Path

Once you've built the code run it by invoking the executable with
one or more integers as command line arguments. If you pass a 
non-integer, an error will be recorded. The program's exit code
indicates the number of error found. 0 indicating success,
i.e. zero errors found.
