Invoking make in this directory will cause all projects
in this directory to be built.

Makefile.latest is a link to the latest evolution of the
project makefile. For any new project in this directory,
copy this file into your project and edit it as needed.

If you improve the Makefile, then change the symbolic
link Makefile.latest to point to the Makefile in your
project.

Note that the Makefile in this directory is a
meta-Makefile, that invokes all the project specific
Makefiles. It is not directly related to Makefile.latest
DO NOT copy Makefile.latest to be the Makefile for this
cplusplus directory.
