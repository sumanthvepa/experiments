/*
  Unlike comments in C, 

  /* Swift multiline comments in Swift can be nested.*/

  // You can also nest single line comments

/**
 This function takes an integer and a  double, adds them and converts the result to a string
 The purpose of this function is to demonstrate various aspects involved in documenting a
 function.
 
 Notice that the functions parameters are documented in the parameters section,
 its return value is documented in the return section and the exceptions it raises
 are documented in the throws section.
 
 You can include links in the docmentation comments much like you would with
 markup. [This is the text of a link to Google](https://www.google.com)
 
 You can reference other functions with double backticks like this: ``documentedWithDocComment()``.
 See [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38321880/how-to-go-about-adding-a-link-reference-to-another-method-in-documentation-xcode)
 on this feature.
 
 You can create code blocks by leaving one blank line above and below the code block
 and indenting the code block at least 4 spaces or 1 tab from the current indent level.
 This is useful for examples.
 
     for (var n = 0; n < 10; n = n+1) {
      print("Hello, World!")
     }
 
 You can also show code blocks by enclosing them above and below
 with four backtics:
 ````
 for (var n = 0; n < 10; n = n+1 {
  print("Hello World!")
 }
 ````
