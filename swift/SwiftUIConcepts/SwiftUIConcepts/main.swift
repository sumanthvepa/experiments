 * main.swift: Explore SwiftUI concepts outside of the SwiftUI itself.
 *
 * SwiftUI seems to use many design concepts that would benefit
 * from exploration. This command line program explores those
 * concepts outside of SwiftUI itself, so that they can be
 * understood in a toy environment, stripped of the
 * real-world complexities of the actual SwiftUI framework.
