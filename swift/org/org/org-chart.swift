/**
 A utility class that represents the strings that need to be prefixed to the rendering of an employee's box in
 console based org chart to indent the box the right amount and connect it to the rest of the chart.
 
 Each box in this org chart consists of three lines: the top border, the interior text and the bottom border,
 as shown below:
 ```
 +------------+
 | Joko Jokic |
 +------------+
 ```
 Each box is connected to the rest of the org chart by a stem. Depending on where in the org chart
 a given element is located the stem will look slightly different. There are essentially two possibilities.
 First, when the box has no sibling following it. the stem looks like this:
 ```
 |  +--------------+
 +--| Emmet Ergasi |
    +--------------+
 ```
 If the box has siblings that follow it, then the stem looks like this:
 ```
 |  +------------+
 +--| Dian Dagar |
 |  +------------+
 ```
 The part of the prefix that  preceeds this stem, should essentially be the same as the bottom line of
 the parent. For example:
 ```
 |    |  +------------+
 |    +--| Betty Bian |
 |       +------------+
 |         |  +-----------------+
 |         +--| Konrad Kraikupt |
 |         |  +-----------------+
 |         |  +-----------------+
 |         +--| Lars Littlebear |
 |            +-----------------+
 ```
 In the example above, notice that the prefix string for the bottom border for Betty Bian's
 box is the same as the prefix strings for both of her subordinates boxes.
 Betty Bian's bottom border string has the prefix:
 ```
 '|     ' # Vertical bar followed by 5 spaces.
 ```
 This string is also part of the prifix strings for boxes of Konrad Kraiput and Lars Littlebear.
 For Konrad the prefix look like this:
```
 '|         |  '
 '|         +--'
 '|         |  '
 ```
 While for lars the prefix looks like this:
 ```
 '|         |  '
 '|         +--'
 '|            '
```
 In both cases, the first 6 characters are identical to the prefix string of the parent's bottom border.
 This is true recursively as well.  Betty Bian's prefix strings are identical the bottom border prefix
 of her boss's box.
 
 This logic allows us to construct the prefix for strings for an org-chart box, given its parents
 prefix strings and whether it has a sibling that follows it in the hierarchy.
 
 
 The Box prefix struct's non-default initializer implements this logic
*/
struct BoxPrefix {
  let top: String
  let interior: String
  let bottom: String
  
  /**
   Initialize a BoxPrefix struct with empty string.
   
   This is the prefix of the root element in an org-chart.
  */
  init() {
    self.top = ""
    self.interior = ""
    self.bottom = ""
  }
  
  /**

  init(top: String, interior: String, bottom: String) {
    self.top = top
    self.interior = interior
    self.bottom = bottom
  }
  
  /**
   Creates a OrgChartBoxPrefix for an element that has a parent, and possibly siblings that come after it.
   
   This is the code that does the real work in  this structure. It creates the prefix strings as described in the documentation
   for this structure.
   
   If the elment has elements at the same level that follow it, then the prefix looks like this. Assuming that the parent prefix
   look as shown below:
   ```
        top: ' |    |  '
   interior: ' |    +--'
     bottom: ' |       '
   ```
   Then this instance will look as follows:
   
   ```
        top: '  |         |  '
   interior: '  |         +--'
     bottom: '  |         |  '
   ```
   If there are no elements that follow this element at the same level, then the element will look as follows:
   ```
        top: '  |         |  '
   interior: '  |         +--'
     bottom: '  |            '
   ```

    - parent: The prefix of the parent of this element
    - childHasSiblings: True if this element has other elements at the same level that follow it.
