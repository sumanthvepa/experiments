  The html declaration below is the root element of an HTML document.

  "no-js" Design Pattern
  ----------------------
  Note the class "no-js" which is used to indicate that JavaScript
  is not enabled. The primary purpose is to provide a fallback for
  CSS styles or behaviors that rely on JavaScript.

  This is a common design pattern that allows you to apply styles
  or behaviors to elements when JavaScript is not enabled or
  available.

  The idea is that the first javascript file that runs on the page
  will remove the "no-js" class from the html element and add a
  "js" class. The code would look like this:
  <script>
    document.documentElement.className
      = document.documentElement.classList.replace('no-js', 'js');
  </script>

  You can design your CSS to apply different styles based on the
  presence of the "no-js" or "js" class. For example, if your
  application relies on JavaScript to implement a dropdown menu, where
  clicking on a button toggles the visibility of a menu, you can use
  the no-js class to show alternate navigation style where all of the
  menus items are always visible. (TODO: Maybe cover this technique
  in a future prototype e.g. "02-dropdown-menu-no-js".)

  This allows for progressive enhancement, where the website becomes
  more interactive and feature-rich when JavaScript is enabled, while
  still providing a functional experience for users without
  JavaScript.

  In general though, it is better to design the website to be fully
  functional without any JavaScript.

  A finally, very important use of the "no-js" class is to allow the
  CSS styling to display content that is visible to non-human user
  agents, like search engine crawlers, and LLM crawlers. This makes
  for better SEO and LLM results.


  The lang attribute
  ------------------
  The lang attribute specifies the language of the document.
  The value "en" indicates that the document is in English.
  You could get more specific by using a language code like "en-US"
  or "en-GB" to indicate a specific variant of English, but "en" is
  a good default for most cases.

  The lang attribute is important for accessibility and search
  engines, as it helps them understand the language of the content.

  See documentation on the lang attribute in Mozilla's MDN
  Documentation:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang

  The HTTP protocol allows a Accept-Language header to be sent by
  the browser to indicate the user's preferred language. A correctly,
  configured web server will use this header to serve an HTML document
  with the appropriate lang attribute.  The HTML might be generated
  dynamically or statically. If static, it is recommended to name
  the HTML file with the language code, like "index.en.html" or
  "index.en-US.html", so that the web server can serve the correct
  file based on the Accept-Language header. This is not a requirement,
  and also the web server must be configured to serve the correct
  file based on the Accept-Language header.

  For most of the prototype explorations in this repository,
  we wll just set the lang attribute to "en" and only serve
  index.html. If time permits, I will explore a setup that
  serves different HTML files based on the Accept-Language header.

  See Mozilla's MDN Documentation on the Accept-Language header
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language
  for more information on the Accept-Language header.

    meta tags are used to provide metadata about the HTML document.

    The link below loads the stylesheet for this website. You can have
    multiple stylesheets as link tags. The browser will load them and
    treat them as one large stylesheet that contains all the styles
    for your website.

    If multiple stylesheets links are present, the browser will load
    them in parallel. But the order of the link tags determines the
    order in which the styles are applied. The last stylesheet
    link tag will override the styles of the previous ones if there
    are any conflicts.

    Note that IntelliJ IDEA will complain about http URLs (suggesting
    that you use https URLs instead), but this is just a prototype
    and the URL is not reachable from the open Internet, so it
    doesn't really matter. In a production website, you should
    use https URLs for the canonical URL.

    The favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser's
    address bar and in the bookmarks. It is also used by some
    social media platforms to display an icon for the page when it
    is shared.

    The image is a Windows Icon (.ico) format file, which is can
    contain multiple images at different sizes. The browser will
    automatically select the appropriate size based on the context.

    To create a favicon, in .ico format, first create 512x512 pixel
    PNG image, Then use the convert command from the ImageMagick
    package to convert the PNG image to ICO format:
    convert icon.png -define icon:auto-resize=16,32,48,64,128,256 favicon.ico

    You can install ImageMagick on RHEL, AlmaLinux, or CentOS with the
    command:
    sudo dnf install ImageMagick

    This is the main JavaScript file for this website.

    The "defer" attribute tells the browser to load the script
    asynchronously and execute it only after the HTML document
    has been completely parsed.

    The alternative to using defer is to place the script tag
    at the end of the body element, just before the closing
    </body> tag. I prefer to use the defer attribute because it
    keeps all non-display related tags in the head element.

    The only thing this script does is to remove the
    "no-js" class from the html element and add a "js" class.
