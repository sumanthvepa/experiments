# Sticky Footer

## Summary
This website demonstrates how to implement a sticky footer using CSS.
The sticky footer is a basiic layout technique that ensures that the
footer of a webpage remains at the bottom of the viewport, even when
the content is not enough to fill the entire page. 
Without a sticky footer, the footer would appear in the middle of
the page  when there is not enough content to push it down to the
bottom.

If the content is long enough, the footer will naturally be pushed
to the bottom of the page, as it would normally behave in a
standard layout.

## Other Objectives
This is also the first project in the series after the initial
00-boilerplate project. I use this project to also document basic
use of browser developer tools, and make notes on basic HTML and CSS.

## Project Setup
This project is setup using the same techniques use in 00-boilerplate.
See that project for more details on how to set up a project.

## Browser Developer Tools
### Chrome Developer Tools
To show the Chrome Developer Tools window(s), press Cmd-Option-I or
goto the vertical dot menu in the top right corner of the browser
and select "More Tools" -> "Developer Tools". You can also right-click
on the page and select "Inspect" from the context menu.
See this video on the various ways to open the Developer Tools:

website for more details on how to use developer tools on Chrome.

#### Moving the Developer Tools Window
The first thing I do is move the Developer Tools window to the left of
the browser window. To do this, click and drag the three vertical dots
in the top right corner of the Developer Tools window (NOT the top 
level browser window), and choose the side you want the window
to be docked to.

### Firefox Developer Tools
Select the hamburger menu in the top right corner of the browser
and select More Tools -> Web Developer Tools. You can also right-click
on the page and select "Inspect" from the context menu.

#### Moving the Developer Tools Window
To move the Developer Tools window to the left of the browser
window, click the three horizontal dots menu in the top right of
the Developer Tools window, and select the "Dock to left" option.

See the [Firefox Dev Tools website](https://firefox-dev.tools/) for

### Safari Development Tools
You must first enable the Develop menu in Safari. To do this,
open Safari Settings, select the Advanced tab, and check the
"Show features for web developers option" option. This will 
add a Develop menu item to the top menu bar.

To show the Safari Developer Tools window, select Develop -> Show
Web Inspector from the top menu bar.

#### Moving the Developer Tools Window
To move the Developer Tools window to the left of the browser
window, choose the Icon preferred position icon in the top left
of the Web Inspector window.

### Microsoft Edge Developer Tools
TBD. I don't have a Windows machine to test this on at the time
of writing this. I'll update this section when I have a chance
to test it on Windows.

### Which Browser to Use for Development
My preferrence for development is to use Firefox.

## Design
The design of the boilerplate site was made Adobe Illustrator.
This site does not implement the background image layer. To see
what the site as designed in Illustrator, go to the layers tab
and turn off the layer with the image.

## Notes on HTML and CSS
Please see the HTML, CSS and Javascript files for comments
describing everything in them.
