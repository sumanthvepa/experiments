This project is an exploration of the foundations of neural
networks.

The objective of this program is to train a single-layer
perceptron to distinguish between two groups of points that
are on either side of a given straight line.

To start with we need to define the line.

Straight lines have an equation of the form:

y = mx + c

m is the slope of the line, and c is point on y axis where the
line intercepts the y-axis. A slope of 1 indicates a slope of 45
degrees. A slope 0 indicates a horizontal line. A slope of infinity
represents a vertical line. More practically a vertical line would
be represented as x = k where k represents the point on the x-axis
where the vertical line intercepts the x-axis.

See interactive figure 1 for details

For concreteness, let us consider a 2x2 square with a
coordinate system centered at middle of the area. Consider the
line.

y = 2x + 1

All points (xn, yn) where yn >= 2xn + 1 are considered to be in
category 1, while all other points are considered to be in category
2.
